ELiPS is a part of my research project conducted in parraller with my Ph.D. work on finding efficient algorithms on pairing-fiendly curves.
ELiPS was not production ready but I planned to make it installable to so that people interested to work or research can use it with few command.
Now I am plaaning to port my C code to Python. It is my new pet project. Hope the journey will teach me new lessons.
